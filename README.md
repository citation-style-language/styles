# Guidelines

## Style Submission or Edits

To contribute to the style repository:

1. fork the main repository
2. create a temporary development branch and make your changes there
3. commit your changes in one atomic commit per style
4. issue a pull request to the main repository

## File Names and and Style Identifiers

Style id slugs and files names for CSL style must follow these guidelines:

* all lower case
* only valid characters are numbers, a-z letters, and single dash
* include a "csl" extension

So, the following would be valid:

> test-style.csl

These would not:

* TestStyle.csl
* Test Style.csl
* test_style.txt
